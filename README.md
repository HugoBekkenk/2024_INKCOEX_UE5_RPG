<h1>Action RPG – Unreal Engine 5 (C++)</h1>

For my school project, I made an Action RPG using Unreal Engine 5 and C++.  
I've followed the Udemy course: *"Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course by Stephen Ulibarri"* to help guide the development, but I also added many personal features and systems on top of it.

**Note:** I've only included the code in this GitHub project due to the project's size.

I've recorded a playthrough in the project files — feel free to skip through it!
